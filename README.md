The color of the majority of license plates in Iran is simple (white) for Iranian citizens anywhere in the country, Yellow, like in most countries, is for public transportation, including taxis and buses. Red is for government and organizations and offices. Dark green is for military and police vehicles.The structure of the Iranian license plate consists of Persian letters and Persian numbers (a binary set of numbers at the beginning, a letter related to the city, a triple set of numbers, and a binary set of numbers at the end, which is specific to the province.

 The dataset in question contains a variety of vehicles, ranging from motorcycles and cars to heavy and cargo trucks. Changes in the conditions of the photos increased the learning power of the model, such as the presence of a repeated number of photos in different sizes, the application of various noise values, Applying various positional changes from 15 to 180 degrees of rotation of the images themselves and angled photography of cars has resulted in spatial changes of the license plate, different lighting modes including day and night photos, changes in image color, and presentation of one to three color channels of the images are available. The images are in the form of 25,000 data for the main one, 5,000 data for validation, and the rest for testing.
